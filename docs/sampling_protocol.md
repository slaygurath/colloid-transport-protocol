# Soil and Colloid Sampling Protocol

## 1. Introduction
This protocol outlines standardized procedures for collecting field soil samples, extracting and characterizing natural colloids, and preparing synthetic hydraulic fracturing wastewater for laboratory experiments investigating colloid-facilitated contaminant transport.

## 2. Field Soil Sampling

### 2.1 Site Selection
- Choose sites representative of typical soil profiles in areas near hydraulic fracturing operations.
- Consider soil texture (clay, silt, sand), organic matter content, and pH.
- Document site coordinates, land use history, and any known contamination.

### 2.2 Sampling Equipment
- Stainless steel soil corers (0–30 cm depth).
- Polyethylene bags (pre‑cleaned with 10% HNO₃ and deionized water).
- GPS unit, field notebook, permanent markers.
- Coolers with ice packs for sample preservation.

### 2.3 Sampling Procedure
1. Remove surface litter and vegetation from a 1 m² area.
2. Insert soil corer vertically to a depth of 30 cm; extract the core intact.
3. Place each core in a labeled polyethylene bag, seal, and store on ice.
4. Collect at least three replicate cores per site.
5. Record soil moisture, color, texture, and any visible anomalies.

### 2.4 Sample Transport and Storage
- Transport samples to the laboratory within 24 h.
- Store at 4 °C until processing (maximum 7 days).

## 3. Colloid Extraction from Soil

### 3.1 Soil Pre‑treatment
1. Air‑dry soils at room temperature (≤40 °C) until friable.
2. Gently crush aggregates with a ceramic mortar, then sieve through a 2‑mm stainless‑steel sieve.
3. Discard stones and plant debris.

### 3.2 Dispersion and Separation
1. Weigh 100 g of sieved soil into a 1‑L polypropylene bottle.
2. Add 500 mL of deionized water (pH adjusted to 7.0 with 0.01 M NaOH or HCl).
3. Shake on a horizontal shaker (150 rpm) for 24 h at 20 °C.
4. Allow the suspension to settle for 1 h; carefully decant the supernatant containing colloids.
5. Centrifuge the supernatant at 3000 g for 15 min to remove coarse particles.
6. Filter the supernatant through a 0.45‑μm cellulose‑acetate membrane.
7. The filtrate contains the natural colloidal fraction (<0.45 μm). Store at 4 °C in the dark.

## 4. Colloid Characterization

### 4.1 Particle Size Distribution
- Use dynamic light scattering (DLS) or laser diffraction.
- Measure hydrodynamic diameter in triplicate.
- Report mean diameter and polydispersity index (PDI).

### 4.2 Zeta Potential
- Determine surface charge via electrophoretic mobility (Malvern Zetasizer).
- Perform measurements at pH 4, 7, and 10 (adjust with 0.1 M HCl/NaOH).
- Report zeta potential (mV) as a function of pH.

### 4.3 Elemental and Mineralogical Composition
- Analyze by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP‑MS) for major elements (Al, Fe, Si, Ca, etc.).
- Use X‑ray diffraction (XRD) to identify clay minerals (kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite).

### 4.4 Organic Carbon Content
- Measure total organic carbon (TOC) with a TOC analyzer after acidification.

## 5. Synthetic Fracking Wastewater Preparation

### 5.1 Base Solution
- Prepare a synthetic brine mimicking typical flowback water:
  - NaCl: 50 g L⁻¹
  - CaCl₂·2H₂O: 10 g L⁻¹
  - MgCl₂·6H₂O: 5 g L⁻¹
  - KCl: 2 g L⁻¹
- Dissolve in deionized water, adjust pH to 6.5 ± 0.5.

### 5.2 Contaminant Spiking
- Add target contaminants to simulate fracking‑related pollutants:
  - Barium (as BaCl₂): 100 mg L⁻¹
  - Strontium (as SrCl₂): 50 mg L⁻¹
  - Naphthalene (as a representative PAH): 1 mg L⁻¹ (dissolved in methanol carrier)
  - Other organic additives (e.g., guar gum, biocides) as needed.
- Stir for 24 h to ensure complete dissolution.

### 5.3 Quality Control
- Verify contaminant concentrations by ICP‑MS (metals) and GC‑MS (organics).
- Filter the synthetic wastewater through 0.45‑μm membrane before use.

## 6. Laboratory Column Experiments (Optional Outline)

### 6.1 Column Packing
- Pack acrylic columns (10 cm length, 2 cm inner diameter) with homogenized soil.
- Saturate slowly from bottom with synthetic brine to avoid air entrapment.

### 6.2 Injection Protocol
- Inject colloidal suspension (Section 3) mixed with synthetic fracking wastewater (Section 5) at a flow rate of 1 mL min⁻¹.
- Collect effluent fractions at regular intervals for contaminant analysis.

### 6.3 Data Recording
- Record time, volume, pH, conductivity, and turbidity for each fraction.
- Analyze fractions for target contaminants (Ba, Sr, PAHs) using appropriate methods.

## 7. Safety Precautions
- Wear nitrile gloves, lab coat, and safety goggles when handling soils and chemicals.
- Work in a fume hood when preparing organic contaminant spikes.
- Dispose of contaminated materials according to local hazardous‑waste regulations.
